### 2. Admin Feature: Manually Approve Transactions

**Admin Experience:**
- Admin views transaction list in admin panel
- Pending transactions show **yellow "Toggle Paid" button**
- Admin clicks button to manually mark as paid
- Transaction status updates, user can now proceed
- Perfect for handling payment verification issues

**Files Modified:**
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Added toggle button & handler function

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// Added state
const [updatingTx, setUpdatingTx] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Added function
const toggleToPaid = async (tx_ref: string) => {
  // Call admin API with password
  // Refresh transaction list
  // Show success message
};

// Added table columns
<th>Phone</th>

// Added button
{tx.status === 'pending' && (
  <button onClick={() => toggleToPaid(tx.tx_ref)}>
    <Banknote /> Toggle Paid
  </button>
)}
```

---

### 3. Backend: Auto-Data Delivery (Already Existed)

**How It Works:**
- When transaction status becomes 'paid'
- If it's a data transaction → Backend automatically calls Amigo API
- Amigo delivers data to customer's phone
- Status updates to 'delivered'
- Protected by idempotency locks (prevents duplicate deliveries)

**File:** `app/api/transactions/verify/route.ts`
**Status:** No changes needed - already fully implemented

---

## Verification Results

```
npm run build
→ Compiled successfully
→ No errors
→ All types validated
```

---

## Complete User Flows

### Flow 1: Customer Checks Pending Data Purchase

```
1. Customer initiates data purchase
   → Payment gateway shows account details
   → Transaction saved as PENDING (local storage)

2. Customer transfers money
   → Flutterwave receives payment

3. Customer clicks "Check" button in History
   → Status spinner appears
   → Toast: "Checking transaction status..."

4. Backend verifies with Flutterwave
   → Payment confirmed ✓

5. Backend calls Amigo API
   → Data starts delivery

6. Backend updates status to DELIVERED

7. Frontend updates localStorage
   → UI refreshes
   → Toast: "✓ Data delivered! Check your balance."

8. Customer receives data on phone ✓
```

**Total flow time:** 1-5 minutes

---

### Flow 2: Admin Manually Approves Transaction

```
1. Customer initiates purchase
   → Status: PENDING

2. Payment verification fails (connection issue, etc.)
   → Customer cannot proceed

3. Admin verifies payment manually
   → Checks customer bank account
   → Payment confirmed ✓

4. Admin goes to admin panel
   → Transactions view
   → Finds pending transaction

5. Admin clicks "Toggle Paid" button
   → Loading spinner
   → Toast: "Transaction marked as paid. User can now proceed."

6. Backend updates status to PAID
   → Records "Manual Admin Override"

7. Frontend refreshes
   → Customer can now check status
   → Auto-delivery triggers

8. Customer receives data ✓
```

**Result:** Transaction successfully processed

---

### Flow 3: Automatic Data Delivery Protection

```
Multiple simultaneous verification requests for same transaction
         ↓
All try to lock the row with updateMany
         ↓
Only first request wins (Prisma atomic operation)
         ↓
Winner calls Amigo API
         ↓
Loser returns "Lock failed, getting latest status"
         ↓
Result: Single Amigo call, no duplicates ✅
```
